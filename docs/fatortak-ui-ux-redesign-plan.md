# Fatortak UI/UX Redesign Plan

**Status:** Proposal for approval  
**Scope:** Visual system, interaction patterns, page templates, accessibility and rollout  
**Constraint:** Keep Fatortak’s identity and brand recognition. Move from heavy gradients and saturated blues/purples to a calmer, lighter, more professional product UI.  
**Implementation:** None. This document is a plan only.

---

## 1. Design direction

### The problem today

The current UI works, but it feels assembled from several design directions:

- the brand is purple/indigo, while the primary app token is a strong blue;
- some pages use large gradients, glass effects and oversized numbers;
- cards, tables, forms and modals use different spacing, radius and shadow rules;
- slate, gray and raw hex colors are mixed;
- page headers, filters, empty states and actions are not consistent;
- some screens are visually dense while others have too much empty space;
- Arabic and English typography are not treated as one system;
- focus, loading, error and permission states are inconsistent.

### The target feeling

Fatortak should feel:

- **calm** — light surfaces, low visual noise, restrained color;
- **professional** — clear hierarchy, consistent density, trustworthy tables and forms;
- **warm** — soft lilac and neutral backgrounds rather than cold corporate blue;
- **Arabic-first** — typography, spacing and direction designed for Arabic, not mirrored afterward;
- **fast** — fewer clicks, obvious next actions, immediate feedback;
- **accessible** — readable contrast, keyboard support and clear focus states.

### Brand rule

Keep purple/indigo as the identity color. Use it for:

- primary actions;
- active navigation;
- links and focus rings;
- selected states;
- charts and highlights.

Do **not** use a full purple gradient on every page. Gradients are reserved for the logo, the authentication panel and occasional empty-state illustrations.

## 2. Color system

### 2.1 Brand purples

Use a softer, more comfortable purple than the current saturated violet. The palette keeps the identity while reducing visual fatigue.

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `brand-50` | `#F6F4FF` | page tint, selected nav, subtle background |
| `brand-100` | `#ECE8FF` | active nav pill, soft badges |
| `brand-200` | `#D9D2FF` | borders, chart fills |
| `brand-300` | `#B9ACFF` | hover accents, disabled strong |
| `brand-400` | `#9584F5` | secondary charts |
| `brand-500` | `#7C63E8` | brand accent, icons |
| `brand-600` | `#6A4FD8` | primary button, links |
| `brand-700` | `#583DBE` | hover, pressed |
| `brand-800` | `#472F99` | headings on tinted surfaces |
| `brand-900` | `#36236F` | high-emphasis text on light lilac |

Primary button: `brand-600` with white text. Hover `brand-700`. Active `brand-800`.

### 2.2 Neutrals

| Token | Hex | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `canvas` | `#F7F8FC` | app background |
| `surface` | `#FFFFFF` | cards, tables, modals |
| `surface-alt` | `#F1F3F9` | table header, muted panels |
| `border` | `#E4E7EE` | default border |
| `border-strong` | `#D3D8E2` | inputs, dividers |
| `text` | `#1B1F2A` | primary text |
| `text-secondary` | `#5B6475` | descriptions, labels |
| `text-muted` | `#8A93A5` | placeholders, metadata |
| `text-disabled` | `#B2B9C7` | disabled |

Do not use pure black `#000` or pure gray `#808080`.

### 2.3 Semantic colors

| Token | Text/icon | Background | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| Success | `#0F9F6E` | `#E9F9F2` | paid, active, positive |
| Warning | `#B87508` | `#FFF7E8` | pending, due soon, trial |
| Danger | `#D64545` | `#FDECEC` | overdue, destructive, errors |
| Info | `#3B6FE0` | `#EDF3FF` | informational, neutral actions |
| Neutral | `#5B6475` | `#F1F3F9` | draft, archived, inactive |

Never use a saturated background for a large area. Use the tint as background and the darker tone for text/icon.

### 2.4 Charts

Use a six-color chart palette derived from the brand:

1. `#6A4FD8` — brand purple
2. `#1C9A8B` — teal
3. `#E0A23A` — amber
4. `#3B6FE0` — blue
5. `#C85C8E` — rose
6. `#7D8CA3` — slate

Rules:

- one accent series, others neutral;
- grid lines at 8–10% opacity;
- no 3D, no heavy shadows;
- legends below the chart, not floating;
- always provide a table or accessible summary.

### 2.5 Dark mode

Dark mode should be soft, not black:

| Token | Hex |
|---|---|
| canvas | `#0E1220` |
| surface | `#151A2B` |
| surface-alt | `#1B2236` |
| border | `#2A3348` |
| text | `#EDF0F7` |
| text-secondary | `#A9B3C6` |
| brand-500 | `#9B8AF7` |

Avoid pure black and pure white in dark mode. Test contrast separately.

---

## 3. Typography

### 3.1 Font pairing

- **Arabic:** IBM Plex Sans Arabic or Noto Kufi Arabic. Prefer IBM Plex Sans Arabic for UI; Noto Kufi for headings only if needed.
- **Latin:** Inter (already used) or Plus Jakarta Sans.
- **Numbers:** tabular numerals for tables, invoices and financial reports.

Load Arabic and Latin with `unicode-range` so each script uses the right font without a flash of fallback text.

### 3.2 Type scale

| Style | Size | Weight | Line height | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Display | 30–36 | 700 | 1.2 | auth/landing only |
| Page title | 24 | 700 | 1.3 | page header |
| Section title | 18 | 600 | 1.4 | card/section |
| Card title | 16 | 600 | 1.4 | cards |
| Body | 14 | 400 | 1.6 (Arabic 1.75) | content |
| Label | 13 | 500 | 1.4 | form labels |
| Caption | 12 | 500 | 1.4 | metadata |
| Micro | 11 | 600 | 1.3 | badges, table headers |

Rules:

- Use 600 for emphasis, not 700/800 everywhere.
- Do not use all-caps for Arabic.
- Avoid letter-spacing on Arabic text.
- Keep line length 60–75 characters for prose.

---

## 4. Layout and spacing

- Base unit: 4px; common spacing: 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40.
- App shell: sidebar 264px expanded, 76px collapsed; header 64px.
- Content padding: 24px desktop, 16px tablet, 12px mobile.
- Content max width: 1440px; forms max width 880px.
- Card padding: 20–24px; compact tables 16px.
- Card radius: 14px; inputs/buttons 10px; badges 999px.
- Shadows: `0 1px 2px rgba(16,24,40,.04)` and `0 8px 24px rgba(16,24,40,.06)`. No heavy elevation.
- Use borders before shadows to separate surfaces.

### Grid

- 12-column grid on desktop.
- KPI cards: 4-up desktop, 2-up tablet, 1-up mobile.
- Detail page: 8/4 split (main + side panel).
- Form page: 7/5 split or single column.
- Tables: full width with sticky first/last columns where needed.

---

## 5. App shell and navigation

### Sidebar

- Light `surface` background with a very subtle `brand-50` wash.
- Logo area 64px, divider below.
- Group labels: 11px uppercase (Latin) / 12px Arabic, muted.
- Active item: `brand-50` pill, `brand-700` text, 3px left indicator (right in RTL).
- Hover: `surface-alt`, no heavy color.
- Collapsed mode: icons only with tooltips.
- Submenu: indented, no nested cards.
- Footer: help, version, user.

### Header

- 64px, white, bottom border.
- Global search trigger with `⌘K` / `Ctrl K`.
- Quick-create button (primary).
- Period/branch selector where relevant.
- Notifications, language, theme, profile.
- No gradients.

### Global search / command palette

- One search for pages, customers, invoices, items, projects and actions.
- Recent items and suggested actions.
- Keyboard-first; `Esc` closes.
- Results grouped and keyboard navigable.

### Navigation principles

- Maximum three levels.
- Current location always visible via breadcrumb.
- Back behavior preserves filters and scroll.
- Cross-links: invoice → customer, customer → statement, project → invoices, stakeholder → transactions.

---

## 8. UX flows and interaction rules

### First-run experience

- Onboarding checklist: company profile, chart of accounts, first customer, first invoice, team invite.
- Dismissible, progress persisted.
- Demo data option for evaluation.

### Permissions

- Disable or hide actions the user cannot perform.
- Explain why: “Ask an admin to grant the Editor role.”
- Server remains the source of truth; UI is not security.

### Destructive actions

- Confirm with entity name and consequence.
- Prefer soft delete/archive where possible.
- Undo toast for reversible actions.

### Forms

- Validate on blur and submit, not on every keystroke.
- Preserve drafts in local state.
- Warn before leaving with unsaved changes.
- Show server validation beside the field when possible.

### Search and filters

- Debounced search, 300ms.
- Filters visible as chips; clear-all.
- Preserve filters in the URL for shareable views.
- Saved views per user/tenant.

### Empty states

- Explain what will appear here.
- One primary action.
- Link to help/docs.

### Error recovery

- Show correlation ID from API.
- Retry action.
- Never show raw exception text in production.

### Keyboard

- `Ctrl/Cmd+K` search.
- `G` then `D` dashboard, `G` then `I` invoices (optional).
- `Esc` closes overlays.
- `Enter` submits forms; `Shift+Enter` newline in textareas.
- Visible focus rings everywhere.

### RTL

- Mirror layout, icons with direction, chevrons, breadcrumbs.
- Do not mirror logos, charts, or media controls.
- Use logical CSS properties (`margin-inline`, `padding-inline`).
- Test every new page in Arabic first, not last.

---

## 9. Accessibility

Target WCAG 2.2 AA.

- 4.5:1 contrast for body text; 3:1 for large text and UI boundaries.
- Visible focus, never `outline: none` without replacement.
- Labels for every input; errors linked with `aria-describedby`.
- Keyboard support for menus, dialogs, date pickers and tables.
- `aria-live` for toasts and async results.
- Reduced-motion support.
- 44px touch targets on mobile.
- Screen-reader test for Arabic and English.
- Avoid color-only status; pair with text/icon.

---

## 10. Motion and delight

- 150–200ms ease-out for hover, menus and dialogs.
- No bouncing cards, infinite tilt or decorative animation in work screens.
- Skeleton shimmer subtle and short.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Confetti only for a genuine milestone, never for routine saves.

---

## 11. Design system implementation

### Tokens

Move all color, radius, spacing, typography and shadow values into semantic CSS variables and Tailwind theme extensions.

Naming:

- `--brand-*`
- `--surface-*`
- `--text-*`
- `--border-*`
- `--success-*`, `--warning-*`, `--danger-*`, `--info-*`

No raw hex in page components.

### Components

Build/standardize in `src/components/ui`:

- Button, IconButton, Input, Textarea, Select, Combobox, Checkbox, Radio, Switch.
- FormField, FormError, FormSection.
- Card, StatCard, PageHeader, SectionHeader.
- DataTable, TableToolbar, Pagination, BulkActionBar.
- Badge, StatusBadge, Avatar, Tooltip, Popover.
- Modal, Drawer, ConfirmDialog.
- Tabs, Breadcrumb, EmptyState, ErrorState, Skeleton.
- Toast, Alert, Progress.
- DatePicker, DateRangePicker, CurrencyInput, NumberInput.
- CommandPalette, SearchInput, FilterBar, FilterChip.

### Documentation

- Storybook for every shared component.
- Figma library matching tokens.
- Usage guidance: when to use, when not, accessibility notes, RTL example.
- Visual regression tests for key states.

### Guardrails

- No arbitrary Tailwind colors in new code.
- No new one-off modal/table/button implementations.
- Every page uses `PageHeader` and `DataTable` patterns.
- Design review required for new screens.
- Accessibility check in pull request template.

---

## 12. Rollout plan

### Phase 0 — Audit and foundations (1 week)

- Inventory every page and component.
- Screenshot current state.
- Approve palette, typography and density.
- Define tokens and component API.
- Set up Storybook/visual regression.

**Exit:** approved token sheet + component inventory.

### Phase 1 — Shell and core components (2 weeks)

- Sidebar, header, page header, cards, buttons, inputs, tables, badges, modals, toasts.
- Light/dark tokens.
- RTL primitives.
- Migrate the stakeholder and installation pages as pilots.

**Exit:** all core components documented; pilot pages pass accessibility and visual review.

### Phase 2 — High-traffic pages (3 weeks)

- Dashboard.
- Sales/purchase invoice lists and forms.
- Customers, suppliers, items.
- Reports hub and top reports.
- Settings and team.

**Exit:** 80% of daily user journeys use the new system.

### Phase 3 — Remaining modules (4–6 weeks)

- Accounting, journal entries, trial balance, ledger.
- Projects.
- HR, payroll, attendance.
- Cheques, custody.
- AI chat, OCR.
- Auth and public invoice.
- Subscription/payment.

**Exit:** no legacy page patterns remain in the primary navigation.

### Phase 4 — Quality and optimization (2 weeks)

- Accessibility audit and fixes.
- Keyboard and screen-reader testing.
- Mobile and tablet QA.
- Performance: code splitting, image optimization, font loading.
- Analytics and feedback round.

**Exit:** WCAG 2.2 AA checks pass; performance budget met.

---

## 13. Page priority matrix

| Priority | Pages | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Auth, dashboard, invoice list/form, customers, reports, settings | Daily use; first impression |
| P1 | Accounting, projects, items, suppliers, team, subscription | Core operations |
| P2 | HR, payroll, attendance, cheques, custody, AI/OCR | Important but lower frequency |
| P3 | Public invoice, installation insights, edge settings | Specialized flows |

---

## 14. Metrics

### UX

- Task completion rate for top 10 tasks.
- Time to create an invoice/customer/project.
- Form error rate and abandonment.
- Support tickets tagged “confusing UI”.
- SUS or in-app satisfaction score.
- Mobile completion rate.

### Visual/technical

- Lighthouse accessibility ≥ 95.
- No critical axe violations.
- CLS < 0.1; LCP < 2.5s on mid-range mobile.
- 100% of shared components in Storybook.
- 0 raw hex colors in page components.
- RTL visual regression pass.

---

## 15. Risks and mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Redesign breaks workflows | Pilot pages, feature flags, user testing before rollout |
| Too much change at once | Phase by page family; keep old components until replaced |
| Brand loses recognition | Keep purple/indigo identity; change saturation and surfaces, not the core hue |
| RTL handled late | Design every component in Arabic first |
| Inconsistent adoption | Shared components + design review + lint guardrails |
| Performance regression | Font subsetting, code splitting, image budgets |
| Accessibility treated as checklist | Automated + manual + screen-reader testing each phase |

---

## 16. Decisions required

1. Approve the softer purple/indigo palette and light canvas.
2. Choose Arabic UI font: IBM Plex Sans Arabic vs Noto Kufi Arabic.
3. Keep both light and dark mode, or light-first with dark later.
4. Approve 14px body / 24px page title density.
5. Approve sidebar 264/76px and header 64px.
6. Approve the page priority order.
7. Assign a design owner and a frontend systems owner.
8. Choose Storybook + visual regression tooling.

---

## 17. Definition of done

- A single token source controls color, type, spacing, radius and shadow.
- All primary navigation pages use the shared shell and page templates.
- All tables share search, filters, empty, loading, error and pagination patterns.
- All forms share labels, validation, required markers, save/cancel and unsaved-change protection.
- Arabic and English are both first-class, with RTL visual tests.
- WCAG 2.2 AA audit passes for critical flows.
- No page uses a one-off gradient, button, table or modal unless documented.
- Dashboard, invoice, report and settings task completion improves in usability testing.

No implementation should begin until the palette, typography and component inventory are approved.
