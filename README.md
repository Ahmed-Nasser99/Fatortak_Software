> **Project status: alpha.** Fatortak is a real, working product used by businesses, but the open-source edition is in its first public release. Expect rough edges, missing tests and breaking changes before `v1.0`. Read [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before exposing an instance to the internet.

## Why Fatortak?

Most accounting platforms are built for the US or Europe first. Fatortak is built for how businesses actually work in the Middle East and North Africa:

- **Arabic-first, not translated later.** Full RTL layouts, Arabic invoices, Arabic PDF fonts and a bilingual UI.
- **One system, not five.** Sales, purchases, inventory, double-entry accounting, projects, payroll and attendance share the same database.
- **WhatsApp-native customer flow.** Send invoices and payment reminders the way your customers already communicate.
- **AI that reads your invoices.** Scan a supplier invoice with OCR and turn it into a draft purchase invoice.
- **Own your data.** Self-host the whole stack with Docker. No per-invoice tax, no vendor lock-in.
- **Open source.** AGPL-3.0. Audit it, extend it, integrate it, or run it on your own servers.

## Product tour

Fatortak is a real application, not a landing-page mockup. The screens below are captures of the running application with demo data:

  <img src="marketing/landing/assets/screenshots/ai-chat.png" alt="Fatortak AI chat answering a question about October revenue with KPI cards" width="49%" />
</p>
<p align="center">
  <sub><strong>Dashboard</strong> — revenue, expenses, cash and receivables in one view.</sub>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <sub><strong>AI assistant</strong> — ask your ledger a question and get the figures back.</sub>
</p>

</p>
<p align="center">
  <sub><strong>OCR invoice</strong> — upload, preview and review before creating the invoice.</sub>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <sub><strong>Income statement</strong> — close the month with a real ledger report.</sub>
</p>

The [landing page](https://fatortak.rabbeh.com/) has an interactive 3D tour of these screens, including the AI chat and OCR flows.

</p>

Every module writes to the same ledger. Project revenue, purchases, expenses and payroll can be linked to a project, so project margin is a ledger number rather than a separate spreadsheet.

A public demo tenant is still on the launch checklist. Until then, the fastest way to see the interface is the Docker quickstart below.

- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Query, i18next (AR/EN + RTL)
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core 8 Web API, Entity Framework Core 8, SQL Server, JWT auth, multi-tenancy middleware
- **AI:** Google Gemini + OpenRouter (configurable), OCR for supplier invoices
- **Deployment:** Docker Compose (API + web + SQL Server) or any reverse proxy

More detail: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- SQL Server 2019+ (Express or Developer edition is fine)
- Optional: Docker Desktop

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Nasser99/Fatortak_Software.git
cd Fatortak_Software
```

### 2. Configure the API

```bash
cd fatortak_backend/fatortak
cp appsettings.example.json appsettings.json
```

Edit `appsettings.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=Fatortak;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
  },
  "Jwt": { "Key": "generate-a-random-64-char-secret" },
  "SeedAdmin": {
    "Email": "admin@example.com",
    "UserName": "admin",
    "Password": "choose-a-strong-password"
  }
}
```

> `SeedAdmin:Password` is required to create the first system administrator. The app never falls back to a default password.

### 3. Run the API

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

The API starts on `http://localhost:5002`; Swagger is at `http://localhost:5002/swagger`.
Migrations are applied automatically on startup.

### 4. Run the web app

```bash
cd ../../fatortak_frontend
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and sign in with the admin account you configured.

### 5. Or run everything with Docker

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env
docker compose up --build
```

- Web: `http://localhost:3000`
- API: `http://localhost:5000`
- SQL Server: `localhost:1433`

See [docs/self-hosting.md](docs/self-hosting.md) for production notes, backups and reverse-proxy setup.

## Configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection` | SQL Server connection string |
| `Jwt__Key` | JWT signing key (32+ random characters) |
| `SeedAdmin__Email` / `SeedAdmin__UserName` / `SeedAdmin__Password` | First system administrator |
| `EmailSetting__Host` / `__Email` / `__Password` | SMTP for invoices and password resets |
| `GeminiApiKey` | Google Gemini key for the assistant and OCR |
| `OpenRouterApiKey` | Optional OpenRouter fallback |
| `VITE_API_URL` | Frontend build-time API URL |
| `Deployment__Mode` | `SelfHosted` or `MultiTenant`; self-hosted bypasses tenant/subscription limits |
| `SelfHosted__AllowRegistration` | Allow new users to join an existing self-hosted installation |
| `App__FrontendBaseUrl` | Public web URL used in password-reset links and public invoice links |
| `Cors__AllowedOrigins__0` | Allowed browser origin for the API |

Self-hosted installations use a single installation tenant, unlimited users/invoices, and an **Installation insights** page for registered users, online sessions and record counts. Set `Deployment__Mode=SelfHosted`; the Docker Compose file does this by default.

Never commit `appsettings.json` or `.env` files. Use environment variables or .NET user-secrets in production.

## Roadmap

See [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md). Highlights:

- [x] Docker Compose + one-command self-hosting
- [ ] Demo dataset and seeded demo tenant
- [ ] Integration tests for invoicing and accounting posting
- [ ] E-invoicing integrations (Egypt ETA, Saudi ZATCA) — research
- [ ] Payment gateway (Paymob / Stripe) for subscriptions
- [ ] Bank feeds and reconciliation
- [ ] Public REST API docs and webhooks
- [ ] Security audit before `v1.0`
