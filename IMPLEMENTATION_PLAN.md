## Product expansion

### Stakeholders

- [x] `Stakeholder` entity: tenant, name, type (shareholder/partner/investor), email, phone, ownership %, equity account, active flag, notes.
- [x] `StakeholderTransaction` entity: tenant, stakeholder, type, amount, date, cash/bank account, reference, description.
- [x] CRUD API with tenant isolation and role checks.
- [x] Transaction types: capital contribution, dividend/distribution, loan received, loan repayment, withdrawal.
- [x] Double-entry posting per transaction type; reversal on delete.
- [x] Stakeholder list + detail page, account balance, transaction history, create/edit modal.
- [x] Validation: ownership 0–100, positive amounts, no over-repayment, no negative balance.
- [ ] Export statement to PDF/Excel/CSV.

### Commercial document chain (missing modules)

The current system jumps from a draft invoice to a paid invoice. A professional sales and purchasing flow needs the full document chain:

- [ ] **Quotation / estimate**
  - customer, validity date, price list, discount, VAT, terms, versions;
  - draft → sent → accepted / rejected / expired;
  - duplicate, print/PDF, email/WhatsApp;
  - convert accepted quotation to sales order or invoice;
  - optional approval before sending.
- [ ] **Sales order**
  - confirmed customer commitment, delivery date, partial fulfilment;
  - convert to invoice or delivery note;
  - cancel/close with reason.
- [ ] **Delivery note / goods issue**
  - quantities delivered, remaining quantities, customer signature/reference;
  - stock movement only on delivery.
- [ ] **Purchase requisition**
  - internal request, requester, department, budget check, approval.
- [ ] **Request for quotation (RFQ)**
  - send to multiple suppliers, compare responses, select winner.
- [ ] **Purchase order**
  - supplier, lines, expected delivery, terms, approval threshold;
  - partial receipt and close.
- [ ] **Goods received note (GRN)**
  - received quantities, rejected quantities, batch/serial if needed;
  - stock and accounts payable accrual.
- [ ] **Supplier bill matching**
  - match purchase order, GRN and supplier invoice; flag price/quantity variance.
- [ ] **Credit note / debit note**
  - linked to original invoice, reason, tax adjustment, ledger reversal, customer balance update.
- [ ] **Recurring invoices / subscriptions**
  - schedule, frequency, start/end, auto-send, retry, pause/resume.
- [ ] **Price lists and customer-specific pricing**
  - currency, validity, quantity breaks, minimum price, approval for override.
- [ ] **Sales commissions**
  - salesperson, rate, basis, payable after payment/collection, ledger posting.
- [ ] **Approval workflows**
  - invoice, quotation, purchase order, expense, payment, discount and credit-note approvals;
  - thresholds, approver roles, audit trail, mobile approval.
- [ ] **Numbering and document versions**
  - separate sequences per document type; immutable issued documents; revision history.
- [ ] **Customer/supplier portal**
  - accept quotation, download statements, upload payment proof, raise support request.

### Competitor parity backlog

- [ ] Credit notes and debit notes with original-invoice linkage.
- [ ] Recurring invoices and scheduled sending.
- [ ] Bank reconciliation workspace (import statement, match, adjust).
- [ ] Approval workflows for invoices, expenses, payments.
- [ ] Audit trail and activity feed.
- [ ] Customer/supplier portal and payment links.
- [ ] Inventory valuation and stock adjustments.
- [ ] VAT return pack and e-invoicing export.
- [ ] Multi-currency and exchange-rate revaluation.
- [ ] Saved views, bulk actions, and CSV import.
- [ ] Global search and command palette.
- [ ] Role/permission matrix editor.
- [ ] Onboarding checklist and demo dataset.

### Self-hosted mode

- [x] `Deployment:Mode=SelfHosted` configuration.
- [x] Single installation tenant; no host/subdomain tenant resolution.
- [x] Unlimited quotas and no subscription requirement.
- [x] Registration joins the installation tenant; optional registration lock.
- [x] Registered user count, online-in-last-5-minutes count, data counts.
- [x] Installation insights page for administrators.
- [ ] Session table with device/IP history (currently uses `LastSeenAt`).
- [ ] Upgrade/backup status on the insights page.

## UI professionalization

- [x] Shared `.input` control style.
- [x] New stakeholder and installation pages use consistent cards, tables, modals, empty states and RTL.
- [ ] Single design-token layer: color, radius, spacing, elevation, typography.
- [ ] Consistent page header: title, breadcrumb, primary/secondary actions.
- [ ] Consistent data table: search, filters, sort, pagination, column visibility, empty state.
- [ ] Consistent form controls and validation messages.
- [ ] Skeleton loading, inline errors, retry states.
- [ ] Modal/drawer patterns with focus trap and keyboard close.
- [ ] RTL-first verification for every new page.
- [ ] Responsive layouts for tablet/mobile.
- [ ] Accessibility: labels, focus rings, contrast, ARIA.
- [ ] Remove one-off gradients/shadows; use a restrained professional palette.

## Verification log

- 2026-10-28: committed and pushed `2955b6b`, `9862e73`, `5c166e4`, `fb9961e`, `d57e4ae`, `a1aa11d` and `fbca486` to `origin/main` (rebased over Dependabot updates).
- Backend: `dotnet build fatortak.sln` → 0 errors.
- Frontend: `npx tsc -p tsconfig.app.json --noEmit` → 0 errors.
- Frontend: `npm run build` → success; one 3.26 MB chunk (857 KB gzip).
- EF: migration `20261027194419_AddStakeholdersAndPresence` generated and scripted successfully; includes `LastSeenAt`, stakeholder tables, and the unique invoice-number index with duplicate cleanup.
- Secret scan of the staged tree: no database, SMTP, Gemini, OpenRouter or JWT secrets; removed Supabase client and OpenReplay key from source.
- Backend tests: `dotnet test` → 8 passed (public invoice token, self-hosted detection, quota limits).
- Health checks: `GET /health` and `GET /ready` added.
- Payroll period uniqueness: migration `20261028103009_AddPayrollPeriodUniqueIndex` with duplicate cleanup.
- Browser auth now uses an HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax JWT cookie; JWTs are no longer persisted in localStorage. `/api/auth/me` validates the session on reload.
- Dependabot updates were rebased onto the branch; `npm install` + typecheck + production build verified with the updated dependency tree.
- Reports hub, invoice-template hub, global error boundary and API exception/correlation middleware added.
- Final verification after rebase: `dotnet test` 10/10, `npm run build` success.
- Local SQL Server smoke test on an isolated `FatortakSmoke_20261029` database: health/readiness, cookie login, `/api/auth/me`, tenant isolation (cross-tenant stakeholder returns 404), stakeholder capital posting, invoice creation with discount/VAT, balanced journal (102.60 debit = 102.60 credit), mark-paid, duplicate, and public invoice token (rejected without token, accepted with token).
- Vite 8 dev server and Chromium UI smoke test: login, dashboard, stakeholders page, reports hub, invoice-template hub, installation insights; no runtime console errors after login.
- UI redesign started: brand palette softened, Arabic font added, sidebar/header refined, dashboard header and KPI cards migrated to the light shared `StatCard` pattern; typecheck, lint and production build pass.
- Dependency review completed: ESLint 10.13, Recharts 3.10 + react-is 19.3, TypeScript 6.0, iText 9.8 + pdfCalligraph 5.1, EPPlus 8.7 with explicit license configuration, Vite 8.3 + plugin 4.3, react-day-picker 10 and react-resizable-panels 4.
- `npm ci` completes successfully; `eslint .` reports 0 errors (31 legacy warnings); `tsc` 0 errors; production build passes.
- All 10 open Dependabot PRs were reviewed and closed with a comment: implemented on main, or deferred because TypeScript 7 is not supported by typescript-eslint and dotnet-ef 10 requires a .NET 10 migration.

## Remaining work (next commits)

| Area | Remaining |
|---|---|
| Security | Move JWT from localStorage to HttpOnly cookies; add refresh-token rotation; add CSP at the Nginx layer; add 2FA/SSO |
| Data isolation | Add EF Core global query filters as defense in depth; finish IDOR audit on every controller |
| Accounting | Add automated journal-balance tests for every posting path; reconcile cheque lifecycle; payroll transaction guard |
| Product | Credit/debit notes, recurring invoices, bank reconciliation, approval queue, audit trail |
| Self-hosted | Session/device history table, backup/upgrade status on the insights page |
| UI | Full design-token pass and professional review of older pages; code splitting; mobile QA |
| Quality | Backend test project, frontend tests, CI secret scan, dependency audit, load test |
| Marketing | Uncommitted `marketing/` changes are intentionally excluded until reviewed and scanned separately |

## Guardrails

- No production secrets in git; use env vars/user secrets.
- Every cross-tenant read/write must include a tenant predicate or be SysAdmin-only.
- Every financial posting must be balanced and transactional.
- CI must fail on compiler errors, type errors, failed tests, and detected secrets.
